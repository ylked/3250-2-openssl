# 3250-2-openssl

## Overview

This project demonstrates practical applications of cryptographic techniques in Python, focusing on key management, encryption, decryption, and digital signatures. It includes a Python script, a Bash script, and a Jupyter notebook each doing essentially the same operations. 

## Files in the Project

- `src/commands.py`: Python script version 
- `src/commands.bash`: Bash script version
- `src/project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook version. Contains more details and examples than the two other scripts

## Getting Started

To run the Python project, ensure you have Python installed, along with necessary libraries such as `cryptography` and `pycryptodome`. The Bash script requires a Unix-like environment to run. Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab is required for the notebook.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 (for Python script or Jupyter Notebook)
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook >=7 (for the notebook)
- Bash (Unix-like environment for the Bash script)
- Required Python libraries: `cryptography`, `pycryptodome` 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```
   pip install cryptography pycryptodome
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook if you're using the notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

- Run the Python script:

  ```
  python commands.py
  ```

- For the Bash script, you might need to make it executable first:

  ```
  chmod +x commands.bash
  ./commands.bash
  ```

- To use the Jupyter notebook, open `project.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab/Notebook and run the cells sequentially. To launch Jupyter Notebook : 
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
